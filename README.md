# Sad History: A Survivor's Account of the Demon Force's Passage

## Project Overview

This document attempts to record events from the perspective of someone directly impacted by the widespread chaos attributed to the 'Demon Force'. It focuses not on the grand battles or divine conflicts, but on the ground-level destruction and loss experienced by ordinary people.

The author is an unnamed factory worker with extensive experience in metalworking and machinery, having spent decades contributing to local industry before the calamities struck.

## Narrative - Before the Storm

Our lives were built on rhythm. The rhythm of the hammers, the rhythm of the presses, the rhythm of the shift changes. Day in, day out. There was a pride in it. Taking raw metal, stubborn and cold, and shaping it into something useful. Tools, simple machines, parts that kept the world turning, at least our small corner of it.

People called me skilled. Maybe I was. I could look at a broken gear and see not just failure, but the precise angle needed to fix it, the exact heat required to make the mend hold true. My hands knew the weight of a good wrench, the feel of perfectly tempered steel. It wasn't glorious work, not like the stories of heroes and gods they told in the tea houses, but it was real. It built things that lasted. It fed families. My family.

We had a small house, smelling faintly of coal smoke and the faint, sweet scent of my wife's cooking. My son, he wasn't much for the forge, his hands were softer, loved books more than calipers. But he was smart, asked too many questions for his own good sometimes. We weren't rich, but we had enough. Enough quiet evenings, enough laughter over simple meals. We were just... living. Building our lives, piece by careful piece, like assembling a complex machine where every part fit perfectly.

## Narrative - The Coming

The change wasn't sudden, not at first. It started subtle. Rumours. Whispers of strange happenings far off. Then the sky started to look wrong sometimes â€“ bruised purples and sickly greens that weren't natural. The air felt heavy, like a storm was brewing, but the rain never came, only a strange, cold dread.

Then, the rhythm broke. It wasn't the predictable breakdown of a tired old machine; it was a violent, tearing force. They didn't arrive with trumpets and banners. They just appeared, or rather, their influence did. Twisted shapes in the periphery, sounds that scraped at your sanity more than your ears. The 'Demon Force', they called it. A name for something that defied understanding.

It wasn't an army I could comprehend. It was chaos given form. They didn't want our resources or our land in the way an invading army would. They seemed to want... breakage. Corruption. To unmake things.

I remember the day it hit our district. I was at the workshop, finishing a delicate joint on a new pump mechanism. The ground didn't just shake; it contorted. The metal around me didn't just rattle; it seemed to scream. Through the reinforced window, I saw things that shouldn't exist walking the streets. Figures wreathed in dark energy, leaving trails of decay in their wake. People didn't fight; they dissolved, or were twisted into shapes I can't bear to describe.

My home... it was close by. I ran. Ran with the desperation of a man who knew how to fix anything but this. The walls weren't just broken; they were blasted, like the very substance of the stone had recoiled in horror. The air was thick with the smell of ozone and something foul, like rotting metal.

I found... I found what was left. Not much. The simple machine of our life, shattered. My wife, the one whose cooking scent was my comfort... she was gone. Not buried in rubble, but... absent. Erased, perhaps. Like a piece of the world was simply removed. My son... I found his books, scattered and scorched, near where his favourite reading chair used to be. No sign of him. Nothing.

## Narrative - The Aftermath

The rhythm is gone now. Replaced by a pervasive silence, punctuated only by the creak of ruined structures and the wind whistling through empty spaces. My hands, capable of such precision, are useless against this kind of damage. You can't mend a life torn apart by that. You can't forge a new family from ash and despair.

I wander through the ruins of the factory sometimes. The machines, once so familiar, are grotesque parodies of their former selves. Metal melted and fused in impossible shapes, tools twisted into useless knots. It feels like a mockery. All that skill, all that hard work, undone in moments by a force that cares nothing for creation, only for destruction.

I see others, survivors. Their eyes hold the same emptiness I feel. We are all just broken parts now, disconnected from the machines of our former lives. We know how to build, how to mend, how to contribute. But what is there left to build? Who is there left to mend for?

They talk of gods and heroes fighting the 'Demon Force' on some grand, cosmic stage. Maybe they are. Maybe they will win. But victory up there... does it mend the broken ground here? Does it bring back the laughter, the rhythm, the simple, real lives that were crushed underfoot?

My history isn't written in divine scrolls or battle chronicles. It's written in the scars on the earth, the silent, empty spaces where my home and workshop stood, and the hollow ache in my chest. It's the sad history of a man who could fix anything made of metal, but was powerless against a force that came only to break the world and the hearts within it. All my experience, all my talent... it counts for nothing against the Demon Force. Nothing at all.
